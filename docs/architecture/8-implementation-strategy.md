## 8.2 Risk Mitigation Strategies

| Risk                                   | Impact | Mitigation                                           |
| -------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Plotly performance with large datasets | High   | Data sampling (max 1000 points), progressive loading |
| Epic dependencies blocking progress    | Medium | Parallel development where possible, Epic 1 priority |
| Complex state management               | Medium | Keep Context API simple, document data flow clearly  |
| Browser compatibility                  | Low    | Target modern browsers, progressive enhancement      |
