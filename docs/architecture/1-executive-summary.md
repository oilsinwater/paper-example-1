# 1. Executive Summary

This document defines the technical architecture for a demonstration microsite showcasing STRUDEL Kit's capabilities for building scientific data exploration interfaces. The application transforms 10,608 human-machine interaction research records into an interactive web platform using an **epic-driven development approach** that demonstrates four core STRUDEL design patterns.

## 1.1 Architectural Philosophy

**Epic-Driven Development**: We organize the application around four strategic epics that build upon each other, ensuring foundational capabilities support advanced analytical features while demonstrating real-world STRUDEL Kit usage patterns.

**Technology Decisions**: We use STRUDEL Kit's standard technology stack to showcase best practices, with React 18 + TypeScript providing type safety, Material UI ensuring consistent design language, and Plotly.js delivering interactive scientific visualizations.

**Performance Targets**: <3s load times, <200ms filter response, >70% component reuse from STRUDEL Kit patterns.
