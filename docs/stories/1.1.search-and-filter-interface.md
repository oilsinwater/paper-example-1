# Story 1.1: Search & Filter Interface

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** Alex (Research Software Engineer),
**I want** to search interaction data using keywords and filters,
**so that** I can quickly locate sequences relevant to my analysis without manually browsing thousands of records.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Typing in the search input updates the visible results within 200ms while updating the Epic 1 search state.
2. Role, efficiency, and time range filters can be adjusted via a collapsible panel; selections immediately update Epic 1 filter state and persist when toggling the panel.
3. Each result card shows role, duration (seconds), efficiency (0–1), and timestamp in a responsive grid layout that adapts to breakpoints.
4. When no interaction sequences match the current search/filter criteria, the interface surfaces a clear empty-state message with guidance to adjust criteria.
5. Users can export the current filtered dataset to CSV from the search interface, and user-facing errors are displayed if the export fails.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Implement `components/epic1/SearchControls.tsx` with debounced input bound to `Epic1State.searchTerm`, meeting the <200ms responsiveness target.

  - [x] Display role, duration (seconds), efficiency (0–1), and timestamp for each `InteractionSequence`, adapting layout across breakpoints. [Source: architecture/4-data-architecture-processing-strategy.md#41-data-model]
  - [x] Ensure grid performance aligns with virtualization/memoization guidance for large datasets. [Source: architecture/5-component-architecture-reusability.md#52-performance-architecture]
  - [x] Present an empty-state panel when no results match, offering next-step guidance. [Source: architecture/3-epic-based-architecture-design.md#31-epic-1-data-discovery-foundation-p0]
- [x] Wire CSV export for the current filtered dataset using client-side export utilities exposed in the data processing layer. (AC: 5) [Source: architecture/2-system-architecture-overview.md#21-high-level-architecture]
  - [x] Add automated coverage to confirm export respects active filters and includes the required columns. [Source: architecture/6-testing-quality-strategy.md#62-automated-testing-matrix]
  - [x] Surface user feedback (toast/dialog) when export succeeds or fails so the workflow is transparent. [Source: architecture/6-testing-quality-strategy.md#64-accessibility-ux-validation]
- [x] Update project documentation or configuration if additional fixtures or scripts are required for Epic 1 testing. [Source: architecture/6-testing-quality-strategy.md#63-test-data-fixtures]

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- No previous Epic 1 implementations are complete; this story establishes the foundation for downstream epics.

### Data Models
- `InteractionSequence` provides role, duration (seconds), efficiency (0–1), timestamp, and metadata fields that must be surfaced in the search results. [Source: architecture/4-data-architecture-processing-strategy.md#41-data-model]
- `Epic1State` tracks `searchTerm`, filter ranges, sort configuration, and pagination, so UI components must read/write these slices. [Source: architecture/3-epic-based-architecture-design.md#31-epic-1-data-discovery-foundation-p0]

### API Specifications
- No specific guidance found in architecture docs.

### Component Specifications
- Epic 1 mandates dedicated components: `FilterPanel.tsx`, `DataCard.tsx`, `SearchControls.tsx`, and supporting utilities such as `data-processing.ts` to manage client-side filtering. [Source: architecture/3-epic-based-architecture-design.md#31-epic-1-data-discovery-foundation-p0]
- Performance architecture emphasizes virtualization and memoization when presenting large result sets to keep UI responsive. [Source: architecture/5-component-architecture-reusability.md#52-performance-architecture]
- Discovery UX should display a helpful empty-state message when no results match and keep the export workflow transparent by signaling errors. [Source: architecture/6-testing-quality-strategy.md#64-accessibility-ux-validation]

### File Locations
- Place Epic 1 UI under `components/epic1/` and drive the discovery experience from `pages/explore/index.tsx`; shared utilities live in `utils/` and dataset fixtures in `data/`. [Source: architecture/5-component-architecture-reusability.md#51-strudel-kit-integration-strategy]

### Testing Requirements
- Run ESLint, TypeScript, and the Jest epic suite (`npm run test:epic1`) locally and in CI; component tests belong under `components/epic1/__tests__/`. [Source: architecture/6-testing-quality-strategy.md#61-quality-gates]
- Cypress end-to-end coverage ensures search/filter flows behave across the stack, and Playwright integration smoke tests run nightly. [Source: architecture/6-testing-quality-strategy.md#62-automated-testing-matrix]
- Maintain synthetic fixtures in `src/data/__fixtures__/` and extend generators in `utils/testing.ts` when new cases are required. [Source: architecture/6-testing-quality-strategy.md#63-test-data-fixtures]

### Technical Constraints
- Keep search/filter interactions below 200ms and maintain <3s initial load to meet success metrics. [Source: architecture/9-success-metrics-validation.md#91-technical-performance]
- Use virtualization and memoization strategies for lists to respect performance architecture guidance. [Source: architecture/5-component-architecture-reusability.md#52-performance-architecture]
- Implement using the standard React 18 + TypeScript + MUI stack defined for the microsite. [Source: architecture/2-system-architecture-overview.md#22-technology-stack-rationale]

### Testing
- Unit: Jest suite under `npm run test:epic1` covering search debouncing, filter reducers, and CSV export utilities. [Source: architecture/6-testing-quality-strategy.md#61-quality-gates]
- Component: React Testing Library specs exercising `SearchControls`, `FilterPanel`, and `DataCard` interactions with Epic 1 context, including empty-state rendering. [Source: architecture/6-testing-quality-strategy.md#62-automated-testing-matrix]
- E2E: Cypress scenarios validating combined search, filter, export (success/failure messaging), and responsive layout flows for Epic 1 discovery journeys. [Source: architecture/6-testing-quality-strategy.md#62-automated-testing-matrix]
