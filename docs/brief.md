# Interactive Adaptive Interfaces Demo - STRUDEL Kit Project Brief

## Project Overview

Transform the "Structured dataset of human-machine interactions" research paper into an interactive microsite demonstrating STRUDEL Kit capabilities, reframing industrial HMI concepts for universal digital interface applications.

**Duration**: 30 days  
**Type**: Interactive research demo microsite  
**Framework**: STRUDEL Kit

## Core Narrative Transformation

### From (Original Research)

Industrial mixing machine operators adjusting parameters to optimize manufacturing processes

### To (Interactive Demo)

"Understanding Digital Behavior: How interaction patterns reveal the path to better interfaces"

### Value Proposition

## Attribution & Ethics

### Citation Approach

- Prominent header: "Based on research by Angela Carrera-Rivera et al., Mondragon University"
- Interactive citations linking visualization insights to paper sections
- "About the Research" section with full academic details
- DOI reference: 10.1038/s41597-023-02741-8

### Ethical Considerations

- Clear statement about anonymized industrial data
- Educational purpose emphasis
- No actual user identification possible
- Benefits of adaptive interfaces balanced with privacy concerns

## Success Metrics

- Engagement: Average 5+ minute session duration
- Interaction: 80% of visitors interact with at least 2 visualizations
- Education: 60% complete at least one learning module
- Sharing: 30% download or share insights
- Technical: <3 second load time, smooth 60fps interactions

## Development Priorities (30-day sprint)

### Week 1: Foundation

- Set up STRUDEL framework and data pipeline
- Create basic layout and navigation
- Implement first interactive visualization (Journey Flow)

### Week 2: Core Interactives

- Build Pattern Explorer with prediction engine
- Develop Temporal Insights Dashboard
- Integrate smooth transitions and animations

### Week 3: Polish & Learning

- Add learning modules and guided tours
- Implement Adaptation Impact Calculator
- Ensure responsive design across devices

### Week 4: Refinement

- User testing and iteration
- Performance optimization
- Final attribution and documentation
- Launch preparation

## Risk Mitigation

- **Complexity**: Start with 2 core visualizations, add others if time permits
- **Performance**: Pre-process data, use sampling for real-time calculations
- **Accessibility**: Ensure keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Understanding**: Include "Why This Matters" context throughout

## Deliverables

1. Fully functional interactive microsite
2. Source code with documentation
3. Usage analytics setup
4. Future enhancement roadmap
5. Case study write-up for STRUDEL Kit examples

This demo will showcase how academic research can be transformed into accessible, interactive experiences that drive real understanding and application of complex concepts.
