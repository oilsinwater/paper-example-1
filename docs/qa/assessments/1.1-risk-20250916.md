# Risk Profile – Story 1.1 Search & Filter Interface

## Summary
- **Story**: 1.1 – Search & Filter Interface (`docs/stories/1.1.search-and-filter-interface.md`)
- **Assessment Date**: 2025-09-16
- **Overall Risk Score**: 78 / 100 (Moderate)
- **Highest Individual Risk**: PERF-001 (Score 6 – High)
- **Key Concerns**: Meeting sub-200 ms responsiveness under full dataset load, ensuring CSV exports respect active filters, establishing resilient state management for downstream epics.

## Risk Matrix

| Risk ID  | Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority | Mitigation Strategy |
|----------|-------------|-------------|--------|-------|----------|---------------------|
| **PERF-001** | Debounced search/filter pipeline may exceed 200 ms when processing 10,608 records on main thread. | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High | Apply memoization/virtualization per architecture guidance, throttle expensive computations, validate performance with production-sized fixtures. |
| **TECH-001** | Initial Epic 1 context/hooks may lack guardrails causing state churn or regressions for later epics. | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium | Define state contracts up front, add integration tests for context updates, document usage patterns for other epics. |
| **DATA-001** | CSV export could omit filter criteria or output malformed data, undermining trust. | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium | Create contract tests comparing displayed vs exported rows, include schema validation and column assertions. |
| **OPS-001** | Error/empty-state messaging may be inconsistently surfaced, hiding failures from demo observers. | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low | Standardize toast/dialog patterns, add UI tests for failure messaging, monitor client logs during demos. |

## Detailed Risk Register

### PERF-001 – Search responsiveness degradation
- **Category**: Performance
- **Affected Components**: `useDataDiscovery`, `SearchControls.tsx`, `FilterPanel.tsx`
- **Detection/Trigger**: Filtering 10k records synchronously or redundant state derivations pushing debounce beyond 200 ms target.
- **Mitigations**:
  - Use memoized selectors (`useMemo`, selectors) and virtualization guidance from architecture section 5.2.
  - Incorporate representative fixtures (10,608 records) in performance tests.
  - Add automated performance checks (e.g., measure handler execution time in tests).
- **Residual Risk**: Medium – dependent on accurate dataset benchmarking.

### TECH-001 – Epic 1 state coupling challenges
- **Category**: Technical
- **Affected Components**: `Epic1Context`, shared hooks, downstream epics.
- **Mitigations**:
  - Document state contract in code comments/readme.
  - Add integration-style tests ensuring context updates remain idempotent.
  - Align implementation with architecture state diagrams to prevent scope creep.
- **Residual Risk**: Low/Medium – should drop once shared hooks land with tests.

### DATA-001 – CSV export integrity
- **Category**: Data
- **Affected Components**: CSV exporter utilities, `pages/explore/index.tsx` export control.
- **Mitigations**:
  - Unit-test export utility to verify filters are respected and columns match `InteractionSequence` contract.
  - Validate CSV headers/encodings; include failure UX per AC5.
  - Provide mock data fixtures covering extreme values (duration, efficiency edges).
- **Residual Risk**: Medium – depends on thorough test coverage.

### OPS-001 – User feedback gaps
- **Category**: Operational/UX
- **Affected Components**: UI messaging layer, telemetry if adopted.
- **Mitigations**:
  - Implement shared toast/dialog pattern; ensure Cypress covers success/failure paths.
  - Capture client errors (LogRocket/console) during demos per deployment strategy.
  - Document fallback steps in runbook.
- **Residual Risk**: Low.

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1 (High)
- Performance benchmarking tests measuring debounce cycle time under full dataset load.
- Cypress/Playwright scenarios verifying perceived response ≤200 ms (e.g., using clock mocks) and empty-state rendering.

### Priority 2 (Medium)
- Integration tests for Epic 1 state context ensuring filters/search term propagate correctly to memoized selectors.
- Export contract tests comparing on-screen filtered count vs CSV rows.

### Priority 3 (Low)
- UX regression tests for error toasts/dialogs.
- Accessibility checks for empty-state messaging and export buttons.

## Recommendations
1. **Development Focus**: Prioritize implementing memoized selectors/virtualization early, before layering UI polish.
2. **Testing**: Add automated performance assertions and CSV contract tests to the Epic 1 test suite.
3. **Deployment**: Keep feature flag or quick rollback option for export functionality in case of demo issues.
4. **Monitoring**: During demos, monitor client console/logs for export failures; track Core Web Vitals for latency regressions.

## Risk Acceptance
- No risks accepted at this time. Reassess after performance benchmarks are in place.

## Monitoring Triggers
- Re-run risk profile if dataset size grows, new backend integration is introduced, or performance benchmarks exceed thresholds.
