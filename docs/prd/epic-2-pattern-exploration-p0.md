# Epic 2: Pattern Exploration (P0)

_Core value delivery - transforms raw data into insights_

**Business Value**: Enables pattern discovery that leads to 40% efficiency improvements  
**User Outcome**: Alex identifies optimization opportunities in user workflows  
**Success Metric**: Users spend average 8+ minutes exploring individual sequences

## User Stories:

**Story 2.1: Interaction Flow Visualization**  
_As Dr. Sarah (UX Researcher), I want to visualize user interaction sequences as flow diagrams so that I can identify common patterns and decision points in user behavior._

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Interactive Sankey diagram shows complete interaction flow
- Hover reveals action details and timing
- Visual highlighting for inefficient paths
- Breadcrumb navigation for deep exploration

**Story 2.2: Pattern Comparison**  
_As Alex, I want to compare multiple interaction sequences side-by-side so that I can identify differences between efficient and inefficient user approaches._

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Select multiple sequences for comparison
- Synchronized highlighting across visualizations
- Metrics showing efficiency differences
- Export comparison insights
