# Cross-Epic Dependencies

**Dependency Rules**:

1. Epic 1 (Data Discovery) must complete before Epics 2 & 3 can begin
2. Epic 2 provides visualization components needed for Epic 3
3. Epic 4 requires data processing patterns from Epic 1
4. No epic depends on future epic functionality (proper sequencing)
