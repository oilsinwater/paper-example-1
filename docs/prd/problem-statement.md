# Problem Statement

Scientific research generates vast datasets, but current data exploration tools are either too generic (failing to handle scientific workflows) or too specialized (requiring extensive custom development). Meanwhile, a groundbreaking study of 10,608 human-machine interactions reveals that **adaptive interfaces can improve user efficiency by 40%** - yet no framework exists to easily build such interfaces for scientific data.

**The Challenge**: Research teams spend months building custom data exploration interfaces instead of focusing on their core research, while missing opportunities to implement proven adaptive interface patterns that could dramatically improve their users' productivity.
