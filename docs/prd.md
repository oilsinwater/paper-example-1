## Data Processing Strategy

typescript

`// All data processing happens client-side (STRUDEL Kit pattern) const processedData = useMemo(() => {   return rawData    .filter(sequence => matchesFilters(sequence, filters))     .sort((a, b) => sortByField(a, b, sortField))     .slice(page * pageSize, (page + 1) * pageSize); }, [rawData, filters, sortField, page]);`

## State Management

typescript

`// React Context for cross-component state interface AppState {   selectedSequences: string[];   filters: FilterState;   compareMode: boolean;   timeRange: DateRange; } const AppContext = createContext<AppState>();`

## MUI Theme Customization

typescript

`const theme = createTheme({   palette: {     primary: {       main: '#1976d2',    // STRUDEL blue     },     secondary: {       main: '#dc004e',    // Accent color     },     background: {       default: '#fafafa',       paper: '#ffffff',     },   },   typography: {     h1: { fontSize: '2.5rem', fontWeight: 500 },     h2: { fontSize: '2rem', fontWeight: 500 },     // Scientific UI optimized typography   },   components: {     MuiCard: {       defaultProps: {         variant: 'outlined',       },     },     MuiButton: {       defaultProps: {         disableElevation: true,       },     },   }, });`
